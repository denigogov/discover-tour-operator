# Website Repository

This repository contains the source code for the website hosted at [https://dgogov1.netlify.app/](https://dgogov1.netlify.app/). The website is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. **It was developed before starting the bootcamp** but has now been uploaded to GitHub for version control and collaboration.

## Future Migration to React

In the future, there are plans to migrate this project to React to take advantage of its component-based architecture and enhanced development capabilities. By migrating to React, we aim to improve code organization, maintainability, and introduce additional features.

1. Open the repository folder.

2. Locate the HTML file (index.html) and right-click on it.

3. Choose "Open with Live Server" from the context menu. This will launch the website in your default browser using a local development server.
